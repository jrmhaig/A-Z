Code Club's [A-Z] of Code
=========================

An activity/colouring book for kids for indoctrinating them with geekyness. Mostly full of in-jokes and puns.


A is for Automaton
------------------

__Description:__ Automaton is a big word but a small idea, a tiny computer that works with pictures and rules.

__Illustration:__ INSERT: 1-d Automaton.

__Activity:__

B is for Benoit B Mandelbrot
----------------------------

__Description:__ Benoit loved Nature, and took walks on the beach. He thought he could see how long it was. Unfortunately the closer he looked, the longer it took, and the more he inspected the more wobbly it got.

__Illustration:__ fractals, duh

__Activity:__ INSERT: Grid of numbers to colour in, numbers represent iteration count, and a fractal is drawn.


C is for CERN
-------------

__Description:__ CERN is a big big place to understand the world at the tiniest levels. They take tiny things and bang them together and see what happens.

__Illustration:__ scene from CERN

__Activity:__ find the Higgs boson


D is for Difference Engine
--------------------------

__Description:__ Before we had machine computers we had human computers. When Babbage became tired of all the errors produced by human computers when making nautical tables, he decided to build a machine that would automate the process. He called it the difference engine.

__Illustration:__ Lovelace and Babbage

__Activity:__  INSERT: Spot the Difference.


E is for Edsger Dijkstra
------------------------

__Description:__

__Illustration:__

__Activity:__
INSERT: Matching up/Drawing lines between ( and ), [ and ], { and }, `if` and `end if`.
(A little instruction to say "Make the lines simple and clean, Edsger likes things to be neat!"

F is for Fibonacci
------------------

__Description:__

__Illustration:__ INSERT: A Golden rectangle to fill with rabbits.

__Activity:__  

G is for Grace Hopper
---------------------

__Description:__ Grace Hopper developed the first compiler for a computer programming language. Once Grace was trying to find out why a particular program had stopped working. She found the reason the program was not working was because a moth had gotten into one of the relays. Since then, we call fixing computer glitches "debugging".

__Illustration:__ Grace Hopper, the bug she found and holding a nanosecond.

__Activity:__

H is for Hackspace
----------------

__Description:__ A hackspace is a community-operated workspace where people with interests in making stuff can meet, socialise and collaborate. Often they have cool tools and machines that you can make stuff with, like soldering stations, laser cutters and 3D printers. 

__Illustration:__ scene from hackspace

__Activity:__ put the book down and go hack something


I is for Internet
-----------------
__Description:__ The internet is a series of tubes.

__Illustration:__ spacecat and tubes

J is for Jump
-------------

__Description:__

__Illustration:__

__Activity:__

K is for Knuth, but Don to his friends.
---------------------------------------

__Description:__ Don loves computers and he loves books too. He wrote a book about computers, and wrote a programming language to write Books in. He then wrote a book about this programming language in the programming language to write Books.

__Illustration:__ INSERT: Don on a Pipe Organ

__Activity:__

L is for Logo Turtle
--------------------

__Description:__ Seymour Papert had a dream that computers would be used by everyone to express their ideas and play around with. He created Logo Turtles to show people the way.

__Illustration:__

__Activity:__ INSERT: Solving a maze by the left hand rule / Origami Turtle.


M is for Multiplication
-----------------------
__Description:__

__Illustration:__

__Activity:__ INSERT: Multiplying numbers by counting grids/Geometric method.

N is for Networks
-----------------

__Description:__ FIXME

__Illustration:__

__Activity:__

O is for Open Source
----------------

__Description:__ Open source means sharing and working together. Octocats share their code on GitHub.

__Illustration:__ INSERT: 8 or so Octocats

__Activity:__ customise the octocats. This one is a Cowboy! This one is an Astronaut! This one is a Nurse! This one is a Teacher! This one is You!

P is for Off By One Error
-------------------------
__Description:__ No! P is for Punch cards.

A punch card is an old way of storing loads of data in a small space. The cards can have holes or notches, and can be sorted by machines according to combinations of present or absent holes.

__Illustration:__ INSERT: FIXME

__Activity:__


Q is for Queue
--------------
__Description:__ FIXME

__Illustration:__

__Activity:__


R is for Recursion
------------------
__Description:__
Recursion is breaking down problems into taking the first step, and how to move forwards.

__Illustration:__

__Activity:__ INSERT: Join the dots Koch Snowflake.

S is for Sieve
--------------
__Description:__ FIXME

__Illustration:__ INSERT: Sieve of Erastothenes

__Activity:__ colour in numbers


T is for Turing
---------------
__Description:__ Alan Turing was an English mathematician, wartime code-breaker and pioneer of computer science. After the war, Turing turned his thoughts to the development of a machine that would logically process information. A Turing machine is a hypothetical device that manipulates symbols on a strip of tape according to a table of rules. Despite its simplicity, a Turing machine can be adapted to simulate the logic of any computer algorithm.

__Illustration:__ INSERT: Turing eating an Icecream in the Park, With a rainbow in the sky.

__Activity:__

U is for UNIX™
--------------
__Description:__ UNIX is not just an operating system, it also brought a new, simpler way of thinking with text files and pipelines.

__Illustration:__ INSERT: Raptors.

__Activity:__ Colour in the UNIX Designers' Hair. Dennis, Ken and Brian had Beards too!


V is for Vannevar Bush
----------------------
__Description:__ Vannevar Bush imagined a future where we would have easy access to all previous knowledge like scientific research, encyclopedias, books and pictures. All this information would fit in a really small space, like in our desks. When we jumped form article to article, a trail would be left behind. Notes could be made, and the trails and notes shared with others. At first, these desk would need keys and levers but eventually we would get rid of these, and go from electrical signals in our brains/eyes/hands to electrical signals in the desk without having to translate to mechanical movement first.

__Activity:__


W is for Woz
------------

__Description:__ Steve Wozniak co-founded Apple and invented the Apple I and Apple II computers. 

__Illustration:__ Woz on a segway

__Activity:__ Woz has lost his phones! How many can you see?

X is for Xor Cat and Nand Cat
-----------------------------
__Description:__ Cats can be fussy, but none as fussy as Xor and Nand Cat. I have two bowls for food or water, and I have to put the right things in.

Xor Cat will eat if I put water in one and food in the other.

Nand Cat will eat unless I put food in both.

__Illustration:__ truth tables for cat food

__Activity:__ INSERT: For each bowls, will Xor or Nand cat eat, or both?


Y is for Yak-shaving
--------------------
__Description:__ Yak Shaving is the last step of a series of steps that occurs when you find something you need to do. Like this one time I had to fix my hovercraft. But the garage where the hovercraft lived was so messy, first I had to tidy it up. But I couldn't tidy it up because there was no light due to a broken lightbulb. And I din't have any spare lightbulbs. I'd go buy a lightbulb except the hovercraft wasn't working. I could borrow one from my neighbour, but he wouldn't give me one unit I returned the red panda costume we'd borrowed. And we couldn't return it because some of the stuffing fell out from the tail and we need to get some yak hair to restuff it. And the next thing you know you're at the zoo shaving some yaks because you needed to fix your hovercraft.

__Illustration:__ A poodle-looking yak being shaved next to a bike shed. Plus a camel and a gnu and Larry in a Hawaiian shirt.

__Activity:__

Z is for Zero and One
--------------------
__Description:__ Computers are powerful because they are simple. They see the world in one and zero, and all numbers and letters can be converted to computers.

__Illustration:__ INSERT: ASCII Table.
